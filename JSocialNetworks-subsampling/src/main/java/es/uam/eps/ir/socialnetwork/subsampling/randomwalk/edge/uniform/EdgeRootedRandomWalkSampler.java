 * Uniform Random walk sampler that selects nodes uniformly from their neighborhoods. This 
 * sampler, with a given probability, teleports to the initial node in the random walk.
 * In case the maximum number of iterations is reached, a new random walk is started, changing
 * the origin node of the walk.
 * 
 * This variant recovers a certain number of edges, and, after they have been found,
 * retrieves all nodes in their endpoints and add them to the graph.
