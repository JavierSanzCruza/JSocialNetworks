/**
* Finds a sample of a graph using the method known as Forest Fire Sampling. This method
* is equivalent to the BFS method, but taking edges with a given probability. In case of 
* directed networks, it is possible to determine a probability for incoming and outgoing neighbors.
* 
* In this version, all links among visited nodes are retrieved.
